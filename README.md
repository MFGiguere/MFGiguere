- 👋 Hi, my name is Maxime F. Giguère!
- 👀 I have a Master's degree in philosophy of health and work for a patient's rights organization where I offer training about patient's rights and help with lvl 1 IT support. 
- 🌱 I learnt Python and R as a complement to my regular philosophy courses. They helped me work efficiently and add some quantitative datas to my analyses. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects where my knowledge in philosophy of science and/or my programming skills will come in handy.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at m.f.giguere@outlook.com
