- 👋 Hi, my name is Maxe!
- 👀 I have a Master's degree in philosophy of health and work as IT for a patient's rights organization.
- 📖 At the moment, I just started a doctorate in community health working on integrating patient's self-reported data in the provincial EMR. 
- 🌱 I learnt Python and R as a complement to my regular courses. They helped me work efficiently, add some quantitative datas to my analyses and automate the boring parts of academic research. 
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on projects where my knowledge in philosophy of science and/or my programming skills will come in handy.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at m.f.giguere@outlook.com
